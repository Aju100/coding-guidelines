Use **GET requests** to retrieve resource representation/information only â€“ and not to modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should be **idempotent**, which means that making multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time until another API (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) has changed the state of the resource on the server.
