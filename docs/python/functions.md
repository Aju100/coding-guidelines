#### The following convention should be followed for `def` naming:

* Avoid inbuilt names.
* `snake_case` or descriptive single word in **lowercase** should be used.
* function names should explain the functionality.
* for bound methods in class `self` should be used for first argument.
* for class methods in class `cls` should be used for first argument.
* `decorators` should be named in function convention.
