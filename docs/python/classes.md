#### The following convention should be followed for `class` naming:

* Avoid inbuilt names.
* Classes names should always be `PascalCase`. i.e. `MyClass` 
* Even if you are building datatypes based on inbuilt class use PascalCase. i.e. `MyDict(dict):`
* Describe the class resposibility in name.
* Custom Exceptions should always be named ending with `Error` i.e. `MyCustomError`
